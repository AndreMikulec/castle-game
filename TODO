- change the name --- there already exists game named "castle"!

  "Castle in the rock"
  "High castle"
  "Castle above the mist" ?

- Insert / Delete should only work if in some "fly mode" etc.

- sound configuration do -- allow turning sounds on/off from menu, allow volume control

- remove base_castle, use castle_hall -- base_castle is just a testing model.
  Also remove the sky -- it's copied from lets_take_a_walk.
  Prepare a good starry sky for VRML castle_hall.

- Stage 2 (3 weeks): Jan 22nd - Feb 11th

  Goal #1 (5 Points) - Make a basic playable game engine.
    Give them all my sources (units).
    Prepare base game castle.dpr
    Add redouts/blackouts from szklane_lasy.

- Makefile to pack distro of my game (
  remember to omit .svn subdirs,
  private TODO file,
  remember to add my general units (or give link to camelot sources)
  remember to add svn log (with files, i.e. C-u svn log) of trunk,
    say somewhere that this was developed as part of svn repository.
  )

- binary only distro doesn't need *.blend files.

- Do navigating with mouse, like in Quake

- help (at least beta-testing and English text proofreading!):
