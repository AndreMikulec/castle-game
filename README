"The Castle"

--------------------
Versioning

Version numbers are 0.y.z, where "y" is a stage of PGD competition.
So "version 0.2.0" is what I submit at the end of stage 2 of competition.
"z" is a relase number (will be used in later stages when I will want
to give this game to friends to actually test it before submitting to PGD).

Later, when PGD competition will end and I will continue developing
this game on my WWW page [http://www.camelot.homedns.org/~michalis/],
I will switch to my normal versioning scheme
[http://www.camelot.homedns.org/~michalis/versioning.php].

Creating levels, 3d objects for this game:

The short instruction is:
Use any 3d modeller able to create VRML 1.0 files.

VRML 1.0 format has an official specification and my engine is capable
of handling any VRML 1.0 valid files (actually, even more than that ---
see [http://www.camelot.homedns.org/~michalis/kambi_vrml_extensions.php]).
So my engine is not tied to any particular modelling program.

My favourite 3d modeller is Blender, [http://www.blender3d.org/].
It's open source, it's available for Linux (yeah, Windows too
if you insist :), and it has an enormous set of features.
Including good export to VRML 1.0, of course. There are no special
rules for designing in Blender models for my engine --- just do whatever
you like (and whatever can be exported to VRML 1.0).

I often "wrap" (using WWWInline VRML construction) models produced by
Blender inside some small VRML files written by hand.
For example, data/castle_hall_final.wrl is a small VRML file that is
maintained by hand. It sets up some things that were uncomfortable
(or impossible, due to lacks of VRML 1.0 exporter) to set up from Blender,
and includes data/castle_hall.wrl (by WWWInline { name "castle_hall.wrl" }).
data/castle_hall.wrl file is simply exported from Blender version
of data/castle_hall.blend.

3DS notes: Actually, you can also export your models to 3DS instead
of VRML 1.0. So if your favourite 3d modeller is not able to export
to VRML 1.0 but it's able to export to 3DS --- you can use it too.
But, since 3DS is a closed format, it will never be supported
completely by my engine (just like by any other program, since everyone
has to decode 3DS). In particular, *everything* that can be expressed
in 3DS format and that is understood by me engine can also be expressed
in VRML 1.0. But not vice-versa, i.e. there are some features that
are available with my engine when using VRML 1.0 but that are not available
when using 3DS. So the bottom line is: well, you can use 3DS format
with my engine, it works OK, but VRML 1.0 format is just better :)
