<!-- attack/max_angle on Spider comments:
     Spider is quite flat and has MiddlePosition low and doesn't fly.
     This is analogous to Werewolf situation, but this time it's low.
     Without this special large attack/max_angle value,
     player could avoid attacks just by standing very close to the spider
     (without crouching).

     remove_dead comments:
     Spiders must be removed from level, otherwise a lot of corpses
     may lay on the Cages level (they are spawned there constantly)
     and slow down the rendering.
     Dying animation scales the model down, to make it gradually disappear.
