--------------------
castle_hall todos:
- RoofLine could be textured ?
- stairs do, move button there
- the button should be above alpha sky, otherwise player doesn't actually
  see that level entrance opens.

  maybe force camera pos and dir to the predetermined position to show
  him the animation ?

- Texture punch_through_symbols.jpg: cut this circle from the rest,
  enlarge, add shome sharpness (and contrast, maybe even noise) using GIMP.
  This symbol must be visible!

- remove the sky -- it's copied from lets_take_a_walk.
  Prepare a good starry sky for VRML castle_hall.
  Note that current castle_hall sky makes the effect of "window at the top of the dome" awkward, because the sky outside it actually not visible...

  Current workaround: using stars.jpg sky:
  Stolen from http://www.astrooptik.com/Bildergalerie/latest_namibia/pictures.htm
  right now, replace with something better and free.

--------------------
items todos:
- player must be able to actually swing the EquippedWeapon,
  to hurt enemies etc.

- rename flask_red filenames everywhere to life_potion

- inventory should be able to scroll, when more than MaxInventorySlots items
  are available.

- apply nice "strips" texture to handle of the sword,
  see http://mediawiki.blender.org/index.php/Manual/PartII/Basic_Mesh_Modelling

- some alpha rect around the item's model ?
  test, although it seems that rotating is enough.

--------------------
- test stage 3 entry with Mama

- Stage 4: Add A Boss System -- 25th Mar, 2006
    * 10 Points -- Add a boss to your level that you fight to finish the level.
    * 10 Points -- Basic 'game over' death sequence. Player must be able to die.

- Stage 3: Feb 12th - Mar 4th
  Goal #1 (5 Points) - Add basic enemies to game engine.

- life text on indicator : Life / MaxLife

- flying mode indicator on screen (for now, game message "flying mode on/off"
  will be enough)

- use and test head bobbing in "castle".

- Add redouts on spadanie,
  prepare general engine to make blackouts.
  Take this from malfunction.

- sound configuration do -- allow turning sounds on/off from menu, allow volume control

  Add to "installing and running" in README:
  Note that to hear sounds you should first install OpenAL
  (see [http://www.camelot.homedns.org/~michalis/openal_notes.php#section_install]).

- change the name --- there already exists game named "castle"!
  And there is "Castle Adventure" !

  "Castle in the rock"
  "High castle"
  "Castle above the mist" ?

- Do navigating with mouse, like in Quake

- remove base_castle (or make it hidden ?) --- this was just a testing level.

- help (at least beta-testing and English text proofreading!):

dist-making to-dos:

- possibly calling strip is needed ?
  Not really --- it doesn't improve so much.

  I also tried enabling smartlinking -- again, doesn't improve so much.

  I also tried calling upx. Works great, and exe size is reduced
  greatly, but tar.gz distro size stays the same (because tar.gz
  also compresses the same executables anyway).

- prepare some binary only distro ?
  it doesn't need many things, including all sources and *
  .blend and *.xcf (and some other internals in menu_bg)

- Makefile to pack distro of my game:
  add at some point svn log (with files, i.e. C-u svn log) of trunk,
  add svn log of units changes,
  say somewhere that this was developed as part of svn repository.

  svn log -v file:///home/michal/svn/kambi-svn-repos/ \
    castle/trunk kambi_pascal_units/trunk > ChangeLog

----------------------------------------
Each time before uploading PGD release:

- make sure Version (in castlehelp.pas) is good
- under Linux and Windows:
  - build debug exe from this dir, test
      make -C /win/mojepasy/units/ clean
      open castle.dpr,
      C-F9
      ./castle
  - build release exe from this dir, test
      make -C /win/mojepasy/units/ clean
      open castle.dpr,
      C-F10
      ./castle
  - make dist
  - extract created dist
  - test running from extracted created dist
      rm -f ~/.castle.data
      ln -s /tmp/ggg/castle/ ~/.castle.data
      ./castle
      rm -f ~/.castle.data
      ln -s /win/mojepasy/openGL/castle/trunk/ ~/.castle.data
  - test building from extracted created dist (using `make build-xxx')
