<!-- max_angle_to_attack on Spider comments:
     Spider is quite flat and has MiddlePosition low and doesn't fly.
     This is analogous to Werewolf situation, but this time it's low.
     Without this special large max_angle_to_attack value,
     player could avoid attacks just by standing very close to the spider
     (without crouching). -->
