--------------------
Must-have before next stage:

- Stage 4: Add A Boss System -- 25th Mar, 2006
    * 10 Points -- Add a boss to your level that you fight to finish the level.

- Stage 3: Feb 12th - Mar 4th
  Goal #1 (5 Points) - Add basic enemies to game engine.

Highest priority goals for stage 4:

- design moving AI and attacking AI for alien

- finish CastleCreatures

- player must be able to actually swing the EquippedWeapon,
  to hurt enemies etc.
  (especially because there are no enemies right now...).

- some effects: blood explode when player hits monster,
  separate animation of monster dying.

- then do first boss

- do also collision detection with creatures when *player* moves.

  Maybe player is able to "push" the creatures ?
  (add this fact to key-bindings then. Write also that you can
  push your creatures to force them to fall from high.)

  This must depend on the creature. E.g. for missiles, collision
  results in Explode.

--------------------
Would-be-nice before next stage:

- non-moving creature (just shooting etc.)

- alien model anim must be changed: the corpse must actualy move while walking !
  Otherwise the effect is like "the legs walking, but the corpse is just
  floating constantly"

- animation when creature is hurt

- creatures still can climb high (almost-vertical) walls

--------------------
- creature that attacks from short-range (swordsman, golem etc.)

- I really don't like the "alien" model. It's generally nice,
  but it doesn't fit this game, and I just can't texture it appropriately.
  The basic model was just taken from www.3dcafe.com when I realized that
  I don't have time to make some really nice creature model before
  stage 4 deadline.

  So this creature model is scheduled to be removed and replaced by something
  better after stage 4 deadline.

- put some vertical crates around GlassPrison on basic_castle

- shadow under the creatures would be nice (sgk_shadows should allow
  me to this super-nicely)

- "shrink" spell (that was *coool* in DUKE 3D !)
  "freeze" (it's from DUKE 3D also)
  "fry"
  "throw back" (throws all enemies slightly backward --- this is also useful
     for player to actually see that monsters get hurt when falling from high)

- check with gprof, maybe I can speed up "loading creatures" process ?

- intro moving when the game starts (either movie from the game --- or just some
  nice anim ? Look how much it adds to AirBlast !)

- second weapon, crossbow/bow, that requires another item in your inventory
  (bolts/arrows)

- inventory should be able to scroll, when more than MaxInventorySlots items
  are available.

- test on high resolution screen (19'' etc.) --- do I have this problem
  with screen refresh rate that Eric talkes about ?

  I can implement refresh changes on Windows, like in GLScene:
    /win/mojepasy/delphi/units/not_kambi/GLScene/newest/Source/GLScreen.pas
  see SetFullscreenMode:

      if displayFrequency>0 then begin
         dmFields:=dmFields or DM_DISPLAYFREQUENCY;
         if displayFrequency>vVideoModes[ModeIndex].MaxFrequency then
            displayFrequency:=vVideoModes[ModeIndex].MaxFrequency;
         dmDisplayFrequency:=displayFrequency;
      end;

- sound configuration do -- allow turning sounds on/off from menu, allow volume control

  Add to "installing and running" in README:
  Note that to hear sounds you should first install OpenAL
  (see [http://www.camelot.homedns.org/~michalis/openal_notes.php#section_install]).

- change the name --- there already exists game named "castle"!
  And there is "Castle Adventure" !

  "Castle in the rock"
  "High castle"
  "Castle above the mist" ?

- Do navigating with mouse, like in Quake.
  Hmm. Collides with mouse picking ?

- Some buttons visible at lower part of the screen to access some
  things with mouse and to show (as hints) their key shortcuts ?
  ("i" - inventory on/off, "m" - messages).

- l / L keys are only for testing purposes !

- remove base_castle (or make it hidden ?),
  together with it's sky (this was copied from lets_take_a_walk),
  --- this was just a testing level.

- key names: bold, key meaning = not bold
  This is a nice Mama idea, but it will require changing GLWinMessages implementation, so probably will not be done for PGD compo.

- mail to author of
  http://www.astrooptik.com/Bildergalerie/latest_namibia/pictures.htm
  : permission to use stars.jpg in my game ?

- apply nice "strips" texture to handle of the sword,
  see http://mediawiki.blender.org/index.php/Manual/PartII/Basic_Mesh_Modelling

- some alpha rect around the item's model ?
  test, although it seems that rotating is enough.

- help (at least beta-testing and English text proofreading!):

  mojewww/camelot/e966ccd7cb2e6a5f3798ec26d81d7310/

- some things for menu:

  sound:
    Music: on/off [on]
    Music volume: (slider)
    Sound: on/off [on]
    Sound volume: (slider)

  graphics:
    Allow resizing the screen at startup: on/off [on]
    Texture minification quality: (opengl options)
    Texture magnification quality: (opengl options)
    Blending: (for attrib_blending somewhere)
    Animation smoothness: (slider: between 10 and 100)
      (for AnimScenesPerUnit in CastleCreatures)

  keyboard:
    All keys configurable here.

  load game, save game abilities.

----------------------------------------
dist-making to-dos:

- possibly calling strip is needed ?
  Not really --- it doesn't improve so much.

  I also tried enabling smartlinking -- again, doesn't improve so much.

  I also tried calling upx. Works great, and exe size is reduced
  greatly, but tar.gz distro size stays the same (because tar.gz
  also compresses the same executables anyway).

- prepare some binary only distro ?
  it doesn't need many things, including all sources and *
  .blend and *.xcf (and some other internals in menu_bg)

- Makefile to pack distro of my game:
  add at some point svn log (with files, i.e. C-u svn log) of trunk,
  add svn log of units changes,
  say somewhere that this was developed as part of svn repository.

  svn log -v file:///home/michal/svn/kambi-svn-repos/ \
    castle/trunk kambi_pascal_units/trunk > ChangeLog

----------------------------------------
Each time before uploading PGD release:

- make sure Version (in castlehelp.pas) is good
- under Linux and Windows:
  - build debug exe from this dir, test
      make -C /win/mojepasy/units/ clean
      open castle.dpr,
      C-F9
      ./castle
  - build release exe from this dir, test
      make -C /win/mojepasy/units/ clean
      open castle.dpr,
      C-F10
      ./castle
  - make dist
  - extract created dist
  - test running from extracted created dist
      rm -f ~/.castle.data
      ln -s /tmp/ggg/castle/ ~/.castle.data
      ./castle
      rm -f ~/.castle.data
      ln -s /win/mojepasy/openGL/castle/trunk/ ~/.castle.data
  - test building from extracted created dist (using `make build-xxx')
