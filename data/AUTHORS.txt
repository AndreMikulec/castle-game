    "Found among the first 10 google results for "free 3d models".
    Terms are some open license (like artistic or gpl)."

    License: TODO: unknown.

creatures/ghost/ (only teeth --- the rest of ours)

    Based on vampire teeth from http://www.katorlegaz.com/ .
    Although the models currently available there are explicitly under
    http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/ license,
    the old "vampire teeth" model is not available there anymore.

    License: TODO: the license of the model is lost in time...

Data from other sources: DOOM E1M1 data:

levels/doom/e1m1/
sounds/doom/
textures/doom/

    This data comes from id Software shareware DOOM data.

    The VRML 1.0 version of the mesh and tex coords comes from
    http://www.ocnus.com/models/ , presumably from original doom.wad.
    Textures were extracted from doom.wad with the help of
    XWE (eXtendable WAD editor) and Waded.
    Sounds come also from original DOOM data.
    Music (in sounds/doom/e1m1.ogg) from
    http://www.sirgalahad.org/paul/doom/ , also based on original DOOM data.

    License: proprietary license, copyright by id Software.
    Most likely not freely redistributable (although it's available
    in thousand forms on many websites and included in various games
    as a tribute to DOOM :).

    Do not include these directories in your distribution, if you want
    to have a pure FOSS game!
