  # is moving with constant speed".
  # But it's translated too little to be noticeable in the game,
  # that's why here I translate it a little more.

  # TODO: this is yet another thing that should be written in .blend
  # file, not in this VRML, I just don't have time now to deal
  # with it properly.
