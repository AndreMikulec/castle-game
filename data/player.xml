  This file configures many aspects of player's behavior.

  Note that, unlike e.g. creatures/kinds.xml file, values in this
  file generally *don't have sensible defaults in program's code*.
  After all, this file is used to set these defaults, so if I would
  like to set them in code, I would set them to the same values
  as they are set here...

  Which is to say: you can't simply delete
  values from this file and depend that "game will initialize some
  default player settings". It will not.
