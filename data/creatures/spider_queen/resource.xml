<!-- attack/max_angle for SpiderQueen comments:
     SpiderQueen is large, the same reasoning is behind
     it's attack/max_angle as for Werewolf.
     Note: we could set attack/max_angle > Pi to mean "no limits".
     This would make the trick with jumping/flying on SpiderQueen much harder.
     For now, not used - - - let's allow inventive players to use it.

     radius comments: it has to be quite small (smaller than calculated
     automatically) to allow SpiderQueen to walk without problems
     over the trash lying on the floor on "Cages" level,
     and walk over small spiders, and climb back up into the tunnel.
