<!--
  This file configures many aspects of items' kinds.
  For the documentation and default values of properties that you can
  set here see TObjectKind, TItemKind and descendants
  classes documentation (in units CastleObjectKinds and CastleItems).

  This file is read each time when the program starts.
  When you manually change this file, you can also force reloading this file
  into the game by command "Reload items/kinds.xml file"
  in "Debug options" menu. This way you can test various settings
  without restarting the game. (But note that some item settings don't
  immediately change if you reload this file while the game runs.)

  For available sound names see ../sounds/index.xml. Empty (or not specified)
  sound name always means "no sound for this event".

  Paths should be relative to the location of this file
  (i.e. data/items/ subdir inside "The Castle" data).
  As path delimiter use slashes ("/"), the engine will make sure they
  are handled OK on all platforms.
