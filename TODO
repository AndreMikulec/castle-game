- proofread and spellcheck README.

- possibly calling strip is needed ?
  Not really --- it doesn't improve so much.

- under Linux and Windows:
  - build debug exe from this dir, test
  - build release exe from this dir, test
  - make dist
  - extract created dist
  - test running from extracted created dist
  - test building from extracted created dist (using `make build-xxx')

- upload dist to PGD

--------------------
after stage 2:

- prepare some binary only distro ?
  it doesn't need many things, including all sources and *
  .blend and *.xcf (and some other internals in menu_bg)

- Add spadanie to TMatrixWalker

- Add redouts on spadanie,
  prepare general engine to make blackouts.
  Take this from szklane_lasy.

- sound configuration do -- allow turning sounds on/off from menu, allow volume control

  Add to "installing and running" in README:
  Note that to hear sounds you should first install OpenAL
  (see [http://www.camelot.homedns.org/~michalis/openal_notes.php#section_install]).

- remove base_castle, use castle_hall -- base_castle is just a testing model.
  Also remove the sky -- it's copied from lets_take_a_walk.
  Prepare a good starry sky for VRML castle_hall.

- change the name --- there already exists game named "castle"!

  "Castle in the rock"
  "High castle"
  "Castle above the mist" ?

- Insert / Delete should only work if in some "fly mode" etc.

- Do navigating with mouse, like in Quake

- help (at least beta-testing and English text proofreading!):

  Szymon, Ka¶ka, Grzegorz, Kozak, Herman,

  Wojtkiewicz, Julia, Aga, Ba¶ka, Michalski, Rudy, Kaczmarek, Bednarz+Ula, Bila, Hasior, Kozio³, Staszek,

  Justy¶

- Makefile to pack distro of my game:
  add at some point svn log (with files, i.e. C-u svn log) of trunk,
  say somewhere that this was developed as part of svn repository.
