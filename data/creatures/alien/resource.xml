<!-- Some key properties to making a creature specialized in shooting
  player from long-range:

  - Of course, define model/fire_missile animation,
    and define at least fire_missile/name to indicate the missile name.

    To make shooting more aggressive:
    You can decrease fire_missile/time to fire more often.
    You can increase fire_missile/max_distance to fire from larger distance,
    like a sniper
    (see also close_direction_to_target_speed inside the missile,
    i.e. ../ball_missile/resource.xml in this case, to make the missile "homing").

  - Set preferred_distance to be as large as possible, which usually means
    equal to fire_missile/max_distance. You want the creature to only get
    close enough to shoot, not closer.

  - Make the creature as cowardly as possible:
    Set run_away/life to 1.0, to make creature always run away
    when enemy gets closer than run_aray/distance .
    run_aray/distance is nonzero by default already, but you may want
    to even increase it.

    To really make the creature difficult, you can set a large move_speed
    for a cowardly creature. This will really make it difficult to catch.

  And of course don't overdo any of this. Game is supposed to be fun for players.
