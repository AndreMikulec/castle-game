- water shaders in data/levels/fountain/water_reflections/
  are broken now on desktop,
  not adjusted 100% to use castle_Xxx uniforms.

  Why are there two shader sets?

- GameAnimationTricks simply renders one animation, instead of animating
  two scenes simultaneously.

- "cages" level got awfully slow with EnableFixedFunction = false.

- "gate" - one grave is floating in the air
