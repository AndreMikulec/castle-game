#VRML V1.0 ascii

# Lights for castle_hall_final.wrl
#
# Are inside separate VRML file to give me some flexibility
# and allow for some tricks. E.g. I will want these lights to light
# not only the level, but also some monsters and objects etc.
# That's why I don't define these lights in castle_hall_final.wrl
