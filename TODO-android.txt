- shader water on fountain level adjust to GLES.
  Why it still crashes? should be disabled!

- progress image - sometimes still doesn't show?

- secure in CGE:
  - Add to CGE nice warning when reading from assets before activ:
    It seems you're trying to read game data (stuff in ApplicationData() on Android) before the activity has started, that is: before we called Application.OnInitialize. Usually this happens if you try to read some file from Pascal unit's "initialization" section (like SoundEngine.RepositoryURL or MaterialProperties.URL). You have to change your code to do this later, in Application.OnInitialize or later, it is impossible to read files earlier.
  - mark
    Resources.LoadFromFiles
    Levels.LoadFromFiles
    undefined on Android? Marked with "platform" everywhere?

    hmm, or maybe we should generate our own hidden "Table of contents" when creating apk,
    and read file list from there?

- Android: different walk touch control (rotate on drag), and special button to attack?
  obracanie szybciej.

  Also buttons to enter menu, show items, use items (just click on them) etc.

- Allow scaling touch control size to screen size?
  Allow scaling it by user preference?

  then remove:
  NewControl.Scale := 2; // TODO: hardcoded

- credits enter/exit too quickly now.
  Hm, they accidentally get enter/mouse click that was used to enter the state, so they exit immediately...

- once debug menu easily reachable, revert castle_gall and cages levels visible by default?

- enter over paused scene manager (game menu on hello world leve)
  still causes "notifications" dark area appear

- SetCurrentMenu can become local utility of particular states.
  we should not modify Window.Controls all the time for this.

  - then fix the bug: FadeRect of controls menu may be over menu.

- game menu:
         // TODO:
         if StateControlsMenu.ExitWithEscape
           then pop self

- restore ability to close window after asking:

  procedure CloseQuery(Container: TUIContainer);
  begin
    if MessageYesNo(Window, 'Are you sure you want to quit ?') then
      UserQuit := true;
  end;

- Application.Quit
  does nothing on Android. just remove? or implement on android?

- in game.pas initialization:

  // TODO
  // Window.Container.UIScaling := usEncloseReferenceSize;
  // Window.Container.UIReferenceWidth := ViewportWidth;
  // Window.Container.UIReferenceHeight := 1600;

  then remove FontSize force in gamegeneralmenu.pas
  and fix "bonus demo levels" string

- // TODO, test results, also compress textures on Android
  // TextureMemoryProfiler.Enabled := true;

- // TODO: when to save config on Android? (these 4 lines at the end
  of lpr)

- make all textures already scaled to po2

- remove delays when moving by menus and something gets initialized.

- moon on background skybox is in bad place, often right under menu

- remove CGE deprecation warnings
