--------------------
Must-have before next stage:

Stage 5 (3 weeks): Mar 26th - Apr 15th
Goal #1 (10 Points) - Engine must allow you to play more than one level per play. Design a minimum of 2 levels to be played by optional selection or in sequence.

--------------------
Would be nice before next stage:
- why with wide angle the corner geometry is sometimes clipped ?

- Gate:
  - staircase: excessive polygons clear
  - texture for water
  - fix trees over the water
  - make larger bumps in the ground after making river. Don't forget to fix height of the trees.

  - player behavior with the water:

    He must be able to get under the water.
    Visibility under the water: blueish (blue fog ?)
    He must be able to drown!
    Up/down should work there like when flying (but slower ?)
    Gravity should be slower under the water.

  - try ideas to make rock look even more like a rock:
    more randomization still ?

--------------------
Stage 6:
Goal #1 (2.5 Points) - Create a min. of 3 playable levels.
Goal #2 (2.5 Points) - Add game music and sound effects.
Goal #3 (2.5 Points) - Have a game splash screen showing your game's title.
Goal #4 (2.5 Points) - Add an in-game list of credits listing all involved of it's development.
Goal #5 (2.5 Points) - Have a minimum of 2 mini-bosses you must fight in the game.
Goal #6 (2.5 Points) - Have a minimum of at least 1 kind of enemy per level.
Goal #7 (2.5 Points) - Add an ending sequence of some kind.
Goal #8 (2.5 Points) - Add and design The Big Boss at the end of your game that is tougher than the mini-bosses.

- Creatures<->level collision checking should be done using
  creature's bounding box, not CameraRadius.
  Creature's CameraRadius is a hack, and should be preferably removed.
  Same thing for items<->level.

- "Restore defaults" in Video and Sound options.

- Eric stage 4 comment:
  - you can also get "stuck" when colliding against a wall, instead of sliding.

- Enemies:
  - More enemies attacks.
  - Nice 3d effects (lighting-like things, explosions etc.).
  - Models of the two current creatures need to be improved.
    Model of "alien" creature will probably be just removed and replaced
    by something else.
  - Just add more creatures.
    creature hydra (very tall, very long when killed; will be a nice demo of my good collision checking routines)

- "The Gate" level:
  - volumetric fog (like from malfunction) needed there. I also want to demonstrate fog in my engine...
  - intro under menu: camera floating around level with this fog ?
  - walking down the stairs and down the hill causes player to lose life

- Do Flying creature (Like a ghost ? Only blended things ? Would be nice...)
  - There must be a way to say that some sectors are not important
    for AI for creatures with Flying.

- sectors and waypoints finish, see README for TO-DOs.

- Improve collisions player<->creatures and player<->items to
  check not only final collisions, but also segment collisions when moving ?
  Otherwise when moving fast (or low FPS count, so FpsCompSpeed large),
  this collision check can fail to work.

  This doesn't seem to be a problem in practice, in practice moving speed is
  not so large (unless running on some ancient GPU with 1 frame per second,
  but there the game is not playable anyway...).

- do weather (I have snow and rain from my szklane_lasy, but they look poor...)

- weapon-less attack (does knockback + small damage)

- non-moving creature (just shooting etc.)

- avoiding falling down sometimes doesn't work like it should.
  I think that I know why: I check where the creature will be after
  2 secs, but what if there is a pit between 2 secs and current pos ?
  Fix by checking everything *along the 2 secs way*.

- ball_missile looks rather funny, too colorful.
  It must look like something fiery, or lighting, or just anything
  that seems at least a little dangerous :)

- various kinds of swinging the sword, with various animations.
  Also they can yield various damage and various hit chances.

- Smooth between various creature states.
  I.e. expand the idea of StandToWalkAnimation, for every combination
  and make it automatic.
  Problem: long load times ("Loading creatures...") and memory consumption.

- creatures can climb high (almost-vertical) walls.
  Actually, player can climb almost-vertical walls too !

  This is not so very noticeable now, because there are no high walls
  now, and creatures' AI doesn't let them fall into deep pits now.

  As a workaround, basic_castle's moat has now edges that are wider down,
  so player and creatures are never able to climb up from the moat...
  But that's still just a workaround.

- some effects: blood explode when player hits monster.

- creature that attacks from short-range (swordsman, golem etc.)

- I really don't like the "alien" model. It's generally nice,
  but it doesn't fit this game, and I just can't texture it appropriately.
  The basic model was just taken from www.3dcafe.com when I realized that
  I don't have time to make some really nice creature model before
  stage 4 deadline.

  So this creature model is scheduled to be removed and replaced by something
  better after stage 4 deadline.

- in game, in config controls, escape should go back to game.

- put some vertical crates around GlassPrison on basic_castle

- shadows under the creatures:
  - need to be optimized to enabled by default.
    Then set DefaultRenderShadows to true, and remove the warning in
    CastleStartMenu when changing RenderShadows.

  GDC2003_ShadowVolumes.pdf has many interesting ideas.
  Idea to eliminate occluders based on Frustum+LightPos seems suitable for me
  and relatively easy, implement ?

  Implement and use (when you have to) ZFail,
  test like descr in GDC2003_ShadowVolumes.pdf.

  Add creature option CastsShadow (def true) to turn shadows off
  for some creatures. For ball missile turn them off.

  LightCastingShadowsPosition should be cofigurable.
  Can be inited from LightSet.Lights[0].TransfLocation
  (but this doesn't give so much results usually...)

- "shrink" spell (that was *coool* in DUKE 3D !)
  "freeze" (it's from DUKE 3D also)
  "fry"
  "throw back" (throws all enemies slightly backward --- this is also useful
     for player to actually see that monsters get hurt when falling from high)

- Maybe it's sometimes a good idea to not create separate display
  list for each frame. Instead, it two scenes share the same RootNode
  and differ e.g. only in CurrentMatrix states, then I can use
  one display list and do glPushMatrix,MultMatrix,render,PopMatrix.

  This could save some loading time for e.g. ball_missile anim
  (but not for alien animations, as they change geometry).

  This is also required to convert Symbol and Button on "Castle Hall"
  to use TVRMLGLAnimation class (additional simplification will be that
  only one Symbol model will be needed, not 4 (like now)).

- intro moving when the game starts (either movie from the game --- or just some
  nice anim ? Look how much it adds to AirBlast !)

- second weapon, crossbow/bow, that requires another item in your inventory
  (bolts/arrows)

  When you hold attack key, arrow/bolt appears on your bow/crossbow
  and you're holding the bow. There is also a crosshair (circle target area)
  that "trembles", because your hands are trembling.

  You shoot when you release Ctrl key. The longer you held Ctrl,
  the more power has the arrow (more velocity), but also the trembling
  of your crosshair (and it's circle) is larger, so your accuracy
  is lower.

- inventory should be able to scroll, when more than MaxInventorySlots items
  are available.

- test on high resolution screen (19'' etc.) --- do I have this problem
  with screen refresh rate that Eric talkes about ?

  I can implement refresh changes on Windows, like in GLScene:
    /win/mojepasy/delphi/units/not_kambi/GLScene/newest/Source/GLScreen.pas
  see SetFullscreenMode:

      if displayFrequency>0 then begin
         dmFields:=dmFields or DM_DISPLAYFREQUENCY;
         if displayFrequency>vVideoModes[ModeIndex].MaxFrequency then
            displayFrequency:=vVideoModes[ModeIndex].MaxFrequency;
         dmDisplayFrequency:=displayFrequency;
      end;

  I can do this in my TGLWindow.VideoChange.

- sound configuration do -- allow turning sounds on/off from menu, allow volume control

  Add to "installing and running" in README:
  Note that to hear sounds you should first install OpenAL
  (see [http://www.camelot.homedns.org/~michalis/openal_notes.php#section_install]).

- change the name --- there already exists game named "castle"!
  And there is "Castle Adventure" !

  "Castle in the rock"
  "High castle"
  "Castle above the mist" ?

- Do navigating with mouse, like in Quake.
  Hmm. Collides with mouse picking ?

- Some buttons visible at lower part of the screen to access some
  things with mouse and to show (as hints) their key shortcuts ?
  ("i" - inventory on/off, "m" - messages).

- debug menu is only for testing -- hide somehow at some point.

- remove base_castle (or make it hidden ?),
  together with it's sky (this was copied from lets_take_a_walk),
  --- this was just a testing level.

- key names: bold, key meaning = not bold
  This is a nice Mama idea, but it will require changing GLWinMessages implementation, so probably will not be done for PGD compo.

- mail to author of
  http://www.astrooptik.com/Bildergalerie/latest_namibia/pictures.htm
  : permission to use stars.jpg in my game ?

- apply nice "strips" texture to handle of the sword,
  see http://mediawiki.blender.org/index.php/Manual/PartII/Basic_Mesh_Modelling

- some alpha rect around the item's model ?
  test, although it seems that rotating is enough.

- Not bad creature models from www.3dcafe.com:

  horror/abom
  anatomy_people/creature
  anatomy_people/vampire

- Load / save game ability.

  Place load in the start menu.
  Place save in the game menu.
  In the game menu, when asking before "End Game", do question
  like "Do you want to save the game before ending ?"
  with answers "Save and end the game", "Don't save and end the game", "Cancel".

----------------------------------------
dist-making to-dos:

- prepare some binary only distro ?
  it doesn't need many things, including all sources and *
  .blend and *.xcf (and some other internals in menu_bg)

- Makefile to pack distro of my game:
  add at some point svn log (with files, i.e. C-u svn log) of trunk,
  add svn log of units changes,
  say somewhere that this was developed as part of svn repository.

  svn log -v file:///home/michal/svn/kambi-svn-repos/ \
    castle/trunk kambi_pascal_units/trunk > ChangeLog

----------------------------------------
Each time before uploading PGD release:

- make sure Version (in castlehelp.pas) is good
- under Linux and Windows:
  - build debug exe from this dir, test
      make -C /win/mojepasy/units/ clean
      open castle.dpr,
      C-F9
      ./castle
  - build release exe from this dir, test
      make -C /win/mojepasy/units/ clean
      open castle.dpr,
      C-F10
      ./castle
  - make dist
  - extract created dist
  - test running from extracted created dist
      rm -f ~/.castle.data
      ln -s /tmp/ggg/castle/ ~/.castle.data
      ./castle
      rm -f ~/.castle.data
      ln -s /win/mojepasy/openGL/castle/trunk/ ~/.castle.data
  - test building from extracted created dist (using `make build-xxx')
