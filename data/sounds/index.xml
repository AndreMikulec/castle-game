<!-- Configuration of game sounds. Each sound has a <sound> element.

   `name' is the unique sound name, as defined in CastleSound unit.
   Currently you can have multiple <sound> elements for the same
   name, and they will be processed in order - - - but don't depend
   on it. For future safety each <sound> element should have different
   name. In the future this file will allow you to add new sounds,
   and name them any way you like - - - for now, you are constrained
   to sounds defined and named inside CastleSound unit.

   `file_name' attribute defaults to element_name + '.wav', so in the most
   common situation, when sound named xxx has the filename xxx.wav,
   you don't have to specify filename. You have to specify file_name
   only if the sound needs different file_name (for whatever reason),
   or when the sound currently has no file_name (which means that it will
   not be ever played). In the last case, you should set file_name to
   empty string, i.e. file_name="".

   `gain', `min_gain', `max_gain' set loudness.
   By default (if not specified) gain is 1, min/max are 0/1.

   `default_importance' is the sound importance, for AL sound manager.
   You can place here a simple unsigned int value, but it's strongly adviced
   to use one of predefined special values, like "player" or "default_creature"
   or "level_event".

   For more details see declaration of TSoundInfo record in CastleSound unit.

   Note that you can change this file while the game is running,
   and reload it by "Reload sounds/index.xml" command from the debug menu.
   This allows you to easily test various sound settings without
   restarting the actual game program.
   Note that when using "Reload sounds/index.xml" command:
   - Don't change the "file_name" attribute. I.e. you must exit
     and run the game again to use new sound file_name.
     "Reload sounds/index.xml" is useful only when playing with other sound
     attributes.
   - Changes will only be reflected in newly started sounds,
     not in currently played sounds.

<sounds>
  <!-- Player sounds. -->
  <!--
    Note for player_sudden_pain:
    After trying many sounds (things that sound like someone saying "ouh",
    things that sound like some "thud" etc.), nothing seems to sound OK.

    There are various ways how you can get hurt, and many of
    them already have appropriate sounds - - - e.g. on drowning you get
    player_drowning, on falling down you get player_falled_down. When being
    hit by the creature it's at least supposed that we'll create some
    sounds for particular creatures and their particular attacks
    (e.g. when hit by ball_missile, player gets ball_missile_explode sound
    already).

    So maybe it's not a good idea to create a general sound
    that will be played always when player is wound ? -->
