items todos:
- player must be able to actually swing the EquippedWeapon,
  to hurt enemies etc.
  (especially because there are no enemies right now...).

- inventory should be able to scroll, when more than MaxInventorySlots items
  are available.

--------------------
- Stage 4: Add A Boss System -- 25th Mar, 2006
    * 10 Points -- Add a boss to your level that you fight to finish the level.
    * 10 Points -- Basic 'game over' death sequence. Player must be able to die.

- Stage 3: Feb 12th - Mar 4th
  Goal #1 (5 Points) - Add basic enemies to game engine.

--------------------
- test on high resolution screen (19'' etc.) --- do I have this problem
  with screen refresh rate that Eric talkes about ?

  I can implement refresh changes on Windows, like in GLScene:
    /win/mojepasy/delphi/units/not_kambi/GLScene/newest/Source/GLScreen.pas
  see SetFullscreenMode:

      if displayFrequency>0 then begin
         dmFields:=dmFields or DM_DISPLAYFREQUENCY;
         if displayFrequency>vVideoModes[ModeIndex].MaxFrequency then
            displayFrequency:=vVideoModes[ModeIndex].MaxFrequency;
         dmDisplayFrequency:=displayFrequency;
      end;

- sound configuration do -- allow turning sounds on/off from menu, allow volume control

  Add to "installing and running" in README:
  Note that to hear sounds you should first install OpenAL
  (see [http://www.camelot.homedns.org/~michalis/openal_notes.php#section_install]).

- change the name --- there already exists game named "castle"!
  And there is "Castle Adventure" !

  "Castle in the rock"
  "High castle"
  "Castle above the mist" ?

- Do navigating with mouse, like in Quake.
  Hmm. Collides with mouse picking ?

- Some buttons visible at lower part of the screen to access some
  things with mouse and to show (as hints) their key shortcuts ?
  ("i" - inventory on/off, "m" - messages).

- l / L keys are only for testing purposes !

- remove base_castle (or make it hidden ?),
  together with it's sky (this was copied from lets_take_a_walk),
  --- this was just a testing level.

- key names: bold, key meaning = not bold
  This is a nice Mama idea, but it will require changing GLWinMessages implementation, so probably will not be done for PGD compo.

- mail to author of
  http://www.astrooptik.com/Bildergalerie/latest_namibia/pictures.htm
  : permission to use stars.jpg in my game ?

- apply nice "strips" texture to handle of the sword,
  see http://mediawiki.blender.org/index.php/Manual/PartII/Basic_Mesh_Modelling

- some alpha rect around the item's model ?
  test, although it seems that rotating is enough.

- help (at least beta-testing and English text proofreading!):

Preview of "The Castle"

This is a preview of my new game, "The Castle". I'm developing it for <a href="http://pascalgamedevelopment.com/">PascalGameDevelopemnt</a> "The Big Boss" competition that ends on 7 May 2006. Everyone (who managed to get to this "secret" page) is welcome to download it and try.

... download links, installing instructions as for lets_take_a_walk ...

Help needed :

1. Feedback

<a href="michalis@ca...">Yeah, I really need your feedback.</a> Any kind of feedback is useful. This includes:

- Bug reports. If anything goes wrong, I obviously want to know about it. Describe how to reproduce the bug &mdash; i.e. what you did, what happened, and what you expected to happen. If you think that something works strange, this also qualifies as a bug. If some text inside README file is unclear, this also qualifies as a bug.

  Note that this game requires rather good graphic card available. If the game is awfully slow, then (probably) it's not a bug --- it's just the way it is, and I will not be able to help much. Make sure you have absolutely newest drivers (including OpenGL library) for your graphic card.

- Features. Do you think that anything should be added ? Maybe something should be changed ? Any ideas may be useful here --- new key / mouse commands, changing the behavior of present commands, displaying some things in a different way, etc.

  There are some features that I plan to implement --- like sounds in game, sound configuration from the menu, key shortcuts redefining from the menu, some display properties changing from the menu. And of course new levels, new items, new monsters. Still, exact ideas for new levels, items and monsters are most welcome (see also below for #Creating new levels, items and monsters).

2. Creating new levels, items and monsters

Inside the game archive, in the file called README, I described how you can create new levels, items or monsters for this game. This requires some knowledge of a 3d modelling program (I use <a href="www.blender3d.org">Blender</a>). Any help with designing new levels, items and monsters will be greatly appreciated (and you will be mentioned in CREDITS file etc.).

----------------------------------------
dist-making to-dos:

- possibly calling strip is needed ?
  Not really --- it doesn't improve so much.

  I also tried enabling smartlinking -- again, doesn't improve so much.

  I also tried calling upx. Works great, and exe size is reduced
  greatly, but tar.gz distro size stays the same (because tar.gz
  also compresses the same executables anyway).

- prepare some binary only distro ?
  it doesn't need many things, including all sources and *
  .blend and *.xcf (and some other internals in menu_bg)

- Makefile to pack distro of my game:
  add at some point svn log (with files, i.e. C-u svn log) of trunk,
  add svn log of units changes,
  say somewhere that this was developed as part of svn repository.

  svn log -v file:///home/michal/svn/kambi-svn-repos/ \
    castle/trunk kambi_pascal_units/trunk > ChangeLog

----------------------------------------
Each time before uploading PGD release:

- make sure Version (in castlehelp.pas) is good
- under Linux and Windows:
  - build debug exe from this dir, test
      make -C /win/mojepasy/units/ clean
      open castle.dpr,
      C-F9
      ./castle
  - build release exe from this dir, test
      make -C /win/mojepasy/units/ clean
      open castle.dpr,
      C-F10
      ./castle
  - make dist
  - extract created dist
  - test running from extracted created dist
      rm -f ~/.castle.data
      ln -s /tmp/ggg/castle/ ~/.castle.data
      ./castle
      rm -f ~/.castle.data
      ln -s /win/mojepasy/openGL/castle/trunk/ ~/.castle.data
  - test building from extracted created dist (using `make build-xxx')
