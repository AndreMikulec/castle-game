#VRML V2.0 utf8

# String of the bow must be expressed as a line to be rendered
# as a line in OpenGL.
#
# Otherwise (if you express string as a thin
# e.g. cylinder) rendering results will suck --- when you'll look
# at the bow from large distance, you will see that parts of the
# string "disappear". This is the result of how polys are rendered.
# Rendering instead a simple line will give better results.
#
# This also means that I have to express this line in direct VRML,
# not in Blender, since Blender VRML exporters can't export a simple line...
