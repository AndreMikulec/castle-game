  "body": "# \"The Castle\"\r\n\r\nFirst-person shooter style game in a dark fantasy setting. Your main weapon is a sword, so the fight is mostly short-range. 3 main levels included, packed with creatures, items and sounds.\r\n\r\nUsing Castle Game Engine, see http://castle-engine.sourceforge.net/ . The game 3D graphics look somewhat old, but the source code remains relatively clean --- it's a nice example of a full, complete FPS game using Castle Game Engine.\r\n\r\nComplete documentation for users is on http://castle-engine.sourceforge.net/castle.php .\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nGNU GPL >= 2.\r\n\r\nExcept some data files that are on other licenses, see the data/AUTHORS.txt file for details.\r\n",
