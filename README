"The Castle"
Version 0.2.0

--------------------
Versioning

Version numbers are 0.y.z, where "y" is a stage of PGD competition.
So "version 0.2.0" is what I submit at the end of stage 2 of competition.
"z" is a relase number (will be used in later stages when I will want
to give this game to friends to actually test it before submitting to PGD).

Later, when PGD competition will end and I will continue developing
this game on my WWW page [http://www.camelot.homedns.org/~michalis/],
I will switch to my normal versioning scheme
[http://www.camelot.homedns.org/~michalis/versioning.php].
