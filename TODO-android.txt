- credits enter/exit too quickly now.
  Hm, they accidentally get enter/mouse click that was used to enter the state, so they exit immediately...

- add touch controls on android

- enter over paused scene manager (game menu on hello world leve)
  still causes "notifications" dark area appear

- SetCurrentMenu can become local utility of particular states.
  we should not modify Window.Controls all the time for this.

  - then fix the bug: FadeRect of controls menu may be over menu.

- game menu:
         // TODO:
         if StateControlsMenu.ExitWithEscape
           then pop self

- restore ability to close window after asking:

  procedure CloseQuery(Container: TUIContainer);
  begin
    if MessageYesNo(Window, 'Are you sure you want to quit ?') then
      UserQuit := true;
  end;

- Application.Quit
  does nothing on Android. just remove? or implement on android?

- in game.pas initialization:

  // TODO
  // Window.Container.UIScaling := usEncloseReferenceSize;
  // Window.Container.UIReferenceWidth := ViewportWidth;
  // Window.Container.UIReferenceHeight := 1600;

  // TODO, test results, also compress textures on Android
  // TextureMemoryProfiler.Enabled := true;

- // TODO: when to save config on Android? (these 4 lines at the end
  of lpr)

- make all textures already scaled to po2

- remove delays when moving by menus and something gets initialized.

- moon on background skybox is in bad place, often right under menu
