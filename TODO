- change the name --- there already exists game named "castle"!

  "Castle in the rock"
  "High castle"
  "Castle above the mist" ?

- block +/- keys.

- prepare some background for VRML castle_hall, with starry sky!

- check "program castle" source code.

- Stage 2 (3 weeks): Jan 22nd - Feb 11th

  Goal #1 (5 Points) - Make a basic playable game engine.
    Give them all my sources (units).
    Prepare base game castle.dpr
    Add redouts/blackouts from szklane_lasy.

  Goal #2 (5 Points) - Make a basic level editor.
    write README about using blender, point them to kambi_vrml_examples.zip
    (or give them kambi_vrml_examples.zip)

  Goal #3 (5 Points) - Create a simple level with editor to test (and show off) the engine features.
    (tell them: general demos and tests of the engine are in kambi_vrml_examples.zip;
    make new level for this game -- at least start...).

  Goal #4 (5 Points) - Include a basic documentation of user controls.
    Add on F1 keypress, add somewhere clear note that F1 in game runs help screen.
    Based on MatrixNavigation, so copy initial version from lets_take_a_walk.

- Makefile to pack distro of my game (
  remember to omit .svn subdirs,
  private TODO file,
  remember to add my general units (or give link to camelot sources)
  remember to add svn log (with files, i.e. C-u svn log) of trunk,
    say somewhere that this was developed as part of svn repository.
  )

- binary only distro doesn't need *.blend files.

- help (at least beta-testing and English text proofreading!):
