I was lost in the fog, and then I found myself here.

Creeping forest. I was chasing this wolf for a whole day. At times, it seemed like chasing a ghost. I was wandering about, sometimes keeping on his track, and often just guessing his direction. When I decided to give up, I realized that it's too late. I had to find a shelter for the night. And then the fog came, and the next few hours were like a dream. Is the world changing, or is my fear changing everything I see around ?

I was lost, wandering in the fog, and when the fog came down, I found myself here.
