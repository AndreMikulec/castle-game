# "The Castle"

First-person shooter style game in a dark fantasy setting. Your main weapon is a sword, so the fight is mostly short-range. 3 main levels included, packed with creatures, items and sounds.

Using Castle Game Engine, see http://castle-engine.sourceforge.net/ . The game 3D graphics look somewhat old, but the source code remains relatively clean --- it's a nice example of a full, complete FPS game using Castle Game Engine.

Complete documentation for users is on http://castle-engine.sourceforge.net/castle.php .
