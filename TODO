- Fix mipmapping with sgis extension: don't forget to
  glTexParameteri(pTarget, GL_GENERATE_MIPMAP_SGIS, GL_FALSE);
  when mipmap is not needed, and textures must be 2power of 2 for this!

- K_Left/RightBracket for winapi glwindow version
  (otherwise it will not work in castle under Windows)

- do weather (I have snow and rain from my szklane_lasy)
  do fog somewhere

- when player stops moving, head bobbing should go down automatically

- when creature dies, the effect is not natural, player often feels
  "stuck" and cannot move.
  Maybe I should add creatures to GetCameraHeight ?

- controls menu must be shown in the gamemenu too.

- F1 should not anymore bring help.
  Rename "help" to "Credits" or something like that.

--------------------
Must-have before next stage:

Stage 5 (3 weeks): Mar 26th - Apr 15th
Goal #1 (10 Points) - Engine must allow you to play more than one level per play. Design a minimum of 2 levels to be played by optional selection or in sequence.
Goal #2 (10 Points) - Add basic menus, game options and settings.

- Eric:
There is something about the FOV and/or movement speed that made me feel somewhat queasy after some wandering around in the stage 3 level (not so much in the castle level, but it was more open).

Half-life explains this:

[http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Field_of_View]
Note: Some people experience sickness with the FOV in Half-Life 2 which is set to 75 by default. This is mostly because the default FOV in other games is set to 90. If you are experiencing such problems in Half-Life 2, try to change the FOV to 90 using the command sv_cheats 1;fov 90 in the console.

(FOV is vertical angle in Half-Life 2).

--------------------
Would-be-nice before next stage:

--------------------
- creature<->creature collision is also needed

- weapon-less attack (does knockback + small damage)

- non-moving creature (just shooting etc.)

- avoiding falling down sometimes doesn't work like it should.
  I think that I know why: I check where the creature will be after
  2 secs, but what if there is a pit between 2 secs and current pos ?
  Fix by checking everything *along the 2 secs way*.

- right now pressing Ctrl blocks rotations and moves (because of
  ModsDown = [] in MatrixNavigation). Fix.

- alien model anim must be changed: the corpse must actualy move while walking !
  Otherwise the effect is like "the legs walking, but the corpse is just
  floating constantly"

- ball_missile looks rather funny, too colorful.
  It must look like something fiery, or lighting, or just anything
  that seems at least a little dangerous :)

- various kinds of swinging the sword, with various animations.
  Also they can yield various damage and various hit chances.

- Take TItemKind and TCreatureKind PrepareRender, PrepareRenderSteps, CloseGL
  into one base class, like TGLLoading or something like that.

- creatures still can climb high (almost-vertical) walls.
  This is not so very noticeable now, because there are no high walls
  now, and creatures' AI doesn't let them fall into deep pits now.

- some effects: blood explode when player hits monster.

- creature that attacks from short-range (swordsman, golem etc.)

- I really don't like the "alien" model. It's generally nice,
  but it doesn't fit this game, and I just can't texture it appropriately.
  The basic model was just taken from www.3dcafe.com when I realized that
  I don't have time to make some really nice creature model before
  stage 4 deadline.

  So this creature model is scheduled to be removed and replaced by something
  better after stage 4 deadline.

- put some vertical crates around GlassPrison on basic_castle

- shadow under the creatures would be nice (sgk_shadows should allow
  me to this super-nicely)

- "shrink" spell (that was *coool* in DUKE 3D !)
  "freeze" (it's from DUKE 3D also)
  "fry"
  "throw back" (throws all enemies slightly backward --- this is also useful
     for player to actually see that monsters get hurt when falling from high)

- Maybe it's sometimes a good idea to not create separate display
  list for each frame. Instead, it two scenes share the same RootNode
  and differ e.g. only in CurrentMatrix states, then I can use
  one display list and do glPushMatrix,MultMatrix,render,PopMatrix.
  This could save some loading time for e.g. ball_missile anim
  (but not for alien animations, as they change geometry).

- intro moving when the game starts (either movie from the game --- or just some
  nice anim ? Look how much it adds to AirBlast !)

- second weapon, crossbow/bow, that requires another item in your inventory
  (bolts/arrows)

  When you hold attack key, arrow/bolt appears on your bow/crossbow
  and you're holding the bow. There is also a crosshair (circle target area)
  that "trembles", because your hands are trembling.

  You shoot when you release Ctrl key. The longer you held Ctrl,
  the more power has the arrow (more velocity), but also the trembling
  of your crosshair (and it's circle) is larger, so your accuracy
  is lower.

- inventory should be able to scroll, when more than MaxInventorySlots items
  are available.

- test on high resolution screen (19'' etc.) --- do I have this problem
  with screen refresh rate that Eric talkes about ?

  I can implement refresh changes on Windows, like in GLScene:
    /win/mojepasy/delphi/units/not_kambi/GLScene/newest/Source/GLScreen.pas
  see SetFullscreenMode:

      if displayFrequency>0 then begin
         dmFields:=dmFields or DM_DISPLAYFREQUENCY;
         if displayFrequency>vVideoModes[ModeIndex].MaxFrequency then
            displayFrequency:=vVideoModes[ModeIndex].MaxFrequency;
         dmDisplayFrequency:=displayFrequency;
      end;

  I can do this in my TGLWindow.VideoChange.

- sound configuration do -- allow turning sounds on/off from menu, allow volume control

  Add to "installing and running" in README:
  Note that to hear sounds you should first install OpenAL
  (see [http://www.camelot.homedns.org/~michalis/openal_notes.php#section_install]).

- change the name --- there already exists game named "castle"!
  And there is "Castle Adventure" !

  "Castle in the rock"
  "High castle"
  "Castle above the mist" ?

- Do navigating with mouse, like in Quake.
  Hmm. Collides with mouse picking ?

- Some buttons visible at lower part of the screen to access some
  things with mouse and to show (as hints) their key shortcuts ?
  ("i" - inventory on/off, "m" - messages).

- l / L keys are only for testing purposes !

- remove base_castle (or make it hidden ?),
  together with it's sky (this was copied from lets_take_a_walk),
  --- this was just a testing level.

- key names: bold, key meaning = not bold
  This is a nice Mama idea, but it will require changing GLWinMessages implementation, so probably will not be done for PGD compo.

- mail to author of
  http://www.astrooptik.com/Bildergalerie/latest_namibia/pictures.htm
  : permission to use stars.jpg in my game ?

- apply nice "strips" texture to handle of the sword,
  see http://mediawiki.blender.org/index.php/Manual/PartII/Basic_Mesh_Modelling

- some alpha rect around the item's model ?
  test, although it seems that rotating is enough.

- Not bad creature models from www.3dcafe.com:

  horror/abom
  anatomy_people/creature
  anatomy_people/vampire

  load game, save game abilities.

----------------------------------------
dist-making to-dos:

- possibly calling strip is needed ?
  Not really --- it doesn't improve so much.

  I also tried enabling smartlinking -- again, doesn't improve so much.

  I also tried calling upx. Works great, and exe size is reduced
  greatly, but tar.gz distro size stays the same (because tar.gz
  also compresses the same executables anyway).

- prepare some binary only distro ?
  it doesn't need many things, including all sources and *
  .blend and *.xcf (and some other internals in menu_bg)

- Makefile to pack distro of my game:
  add at some point svn log (with files, i.e. C-u svn log) of trunk,
  add svn log of units changes,
  say somewhere that this was developed as part of svn repository.

  svn log -v file:///home/michal/svn/kambi-svn-repos/ \
    castle/trunk kambi_pascal_units/trunk > ChangeLog

----------------------------------------
Each time before uploading PGD release:

- make sure Version (in castlehelp.pas) is good
- under Linux and Windows:
  - build debug exe from this dir, test
      make -C /win/mojepasy/units/ clean
      open castle.dpr,
      C-F9
      ./castle
  - build release exe from this dir, test
      make -C /win/mojepasy/units/ clean
      open castle.dpr,
      C-F10
      ./castle
  - make dist
  - extract created dist
  - test running from extracted created dist
      rm -f ~/.castle.data
      ln -s /tmp/ggg/castle/ ~/.castle.data
      ./castle
      rm -f ~/.castle.data
      ln -s /win/mojepasy/openGL/castle/trunk/ ~/.castle.data
  - test building from extracted created dist (using `make build-xxx')
