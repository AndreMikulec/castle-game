Available keys:

(keys below are a subset of keys available in my other program "view3dscene" in "Walk" mode):

Basic keys:
  F1 = show this help
  Escape = exit
  Up / Down = move
  Left / Right = rotate
  PageUp / PageDown = raise / bow your head
  Home = restore head raise to initial position (neutralize any effect of PageUp / PageDown)
  Insert / Delete = fly up / down
  Z / X = strafe move left / right

Additional keys:
  Ctrl + Left / Right = rotate slower
  Ctrl + PageUp / PageDown = raise / bow your head slower
  F5 = save screen to file castle_<int>.png
  Ctrl + F = toggle fullscreen mode
