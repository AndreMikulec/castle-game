These scripts work Ok, but for now I don't include their results
as I don't enable bump mapping everywhere on all levels.

Bump mapping will need some improvements to work seamlessly
with "the castle" original levels (fog and multiple lights must also be handled),
and still the levels turn out darker with bump mapping (as usually
happens when applying more physically correct methods, things go darker...).
All in all, I'm not sure whether it's worthy to try to turn bump mapping on
new levels --- maybe I should only focus on designing new levels from
the beginning with bump mapping in mind.
