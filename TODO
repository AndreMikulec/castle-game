- Stage 3: Feb 12th - Mar 4th
  Goal #1 (5 Points) - Add basic enemies to game engine.
  Goal #2 (5 Points) - Add player pick-up items/weapons to engine.
  Goal #3 (5 Points) - Design a better level to test out new features.
  Goal #4 (5 Points) - Provide an 'exit' for the level.

- head "bobbing" (from szklane lasy) add

- Add spadanie to TMatrixWalker

- Add redouts on spadanie,
  prepare general engine to make blackouts.
  Take this from szklane_lasy.

- sound configuration do -- allow turning sounds on/off from menu, allow volume control

  Add to "installing and running" in README:
  Note that to hear sounds you should first install OpenAL
  (see [http://www.camelot.homedns.org/~michalis/openal_notes.php#section_install]).

- remove base_castle, use castle_hall -- base_castle is just a testing model.
  Also remove the sky -- it's copied from lets_take_a_walk.
  Prepare a good starry sky for VRML castle_hall.

- change the name --- there already exists game named "castle"!

  "Castle in the rock"
  "High castle"
  "Castle above the mist" ?

- Insert / Delete should only work if in some "fly mode" etc.

- Do navigating with mouse, like in Quake

- help (at least beta-testing and English text proofreading!):

dist-making to-dos:

- possibly calling strip is needed ?
  Not really --- it doesn't improve so much.

  I also tried enabling smartlinking -- again, doesn't improve so much.

  I also tried calling upx. Works great, and exe size is reduced
  greatly, but tar.gz distro size stays the same (because tar.gz
  also compresses the same executables anyway).

- prepare some binary only distro ?
  it doesn't need many things, including all sources and *
  .blend and *.xcf (and some other internals in menu_bg)

- Makefile to pack distro of my game:
  add at some point svn log (with files, i.e. C-u svn log) of trunk,
  add svn log of units changes,
  say somewhere that this was developed as part of svn repository.

  svn log -v file:///home/michal/svn/kambi-svn-repos/ \
    castle/trunk kambi_pascal_units/trunk > ChangeLog

----------------------------------------
Each time before uploading PGD release:

- under Linux and Windows:
  - build debug exe from this dir, test
      make -C /win/mojepasy/units/ clean
      open castle.dpr,
      C-F9
      ./castle
  - build release exe from this dir, test
      make -C /win/mojepasy/units/ clean
      open castle.dpr,
      C-F10
      ./castle
  - make dist
  - extract created dist
  - test running from extracted created dist
      rm -f ~/.castle.data
      ln -s /tmp/ggg/castle/ ~/.castle.data
      ./castle
      rm -f ~/.castle.data
      ln -s /win/mojepasy/openGL/castle/trunk/ ~/.castle.data
  - test building from extracted created dist (using `make build-xxx')
