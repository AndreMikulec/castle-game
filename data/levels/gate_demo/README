This is a modified (or rather: hacked and practically destroyed :) )
version of "The Gate" level, intended to be used only as a "demo"
level (level displayed in the background of the start game menu).

Water is separated to make an animation. Animation is done extremely
poor: I just created two versions of water mesh, each by fractal
subdivision in blender (parameters: subdivision 20, random fraction 1).
Water animation is just interpolation between these two meshes versions.
