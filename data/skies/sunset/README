This is the sunset sky (used in "Fountain" level for now),
along with all Terragen data files and useful scripts to modify it.

To render the sky, execute in Terragen script background_render_script.tgs,
and then run background_rename.sh. That's all.

If you want to change initial camera position, do it inside
background_render_script_mk.sh, and then rerun it, to make new
background_render_script.tgs script.
