Cages level:
- spider:
  finish the model (head larger ?),
  material,
  textures,
  animate,
  sounds,
  adjust kinds.xml
  new attack: throw some slime/webs ?
- finish: room and queen liar
- creatures: spider, spider queen

- kangury debian: hangs on Quit.

- life indicator of the boss --- this should be a good workaround for lack
  of blood effects etc. for now.

- Update WWW to point to both -with-sources and without versions.

- alien:
  lower MinDelayBetweenAttacks?
  Szymon: samonaprowadzajace sie kulki ?

  (MoveSpeed)
  (02:11:50) Szymon: przede wszystkim duchy powinny byc 0.5
  (02:12:12) Szymon: a alien gdzies tak 0.35. wyglada naturalnie a jest trudniejszy

- mouse sensitivity problems:
  function StrToFloatDef(const s: string; DefValue: Extended): Extended;

  Was there a bug about this in FPC ? I don't remember, but I have this
  in my KambiStringUtils.
  No, the bug that I remembered was for Hex2Dec.

- ask szymon about cages level:
  too dark ?

--------------------
Stage 6:
Goal #1 (2.5 Points) - Create a min. of 3 playable levels.
Goal #3 (2.5 Points) - Have a game splash screen showing your game's title.
Goal #4 (2.5 Points) - Add an in-game list of credits listing all involved of it's development.
Goal #5 (2.5 Points) - Have a minimum of 2 mini-bosses you must fight in the game.
Goal #6 (2.5 Points) - Have a minimum of at least 1 kind of enemy per level.
Goal #7 (2.5 Points) - Add an ending sequence of some kind.
Goal #8 (2.5 Points) - Add and design The Big Boss at the end of your game that is tougher than the mini-bosses.

- "Color depth" and "Display Frequency" are ignored on non-Win32 targets.
  (Seems that judges and most people test on Windows, so no time (it's already 4th May)
  to do this for Unix (xvf86mode) now. "Display Frequency" should be definitely
  possible using xvf86mode, "Color depth" --- I'm not sure. Possibly
  color depth is not switchable without restarting XWindows ?
  Look at xvidtune.
  Look at gnome program to change screen resolutions.)

- thunder:
  - 3d sound ?
  - if the light would only shine through the window's shapes it would be even better.

Cages level:
- this natural rock thing better ?
- torch model base : use nice mesh from the base on lantern3.3ds from 3dcafe.com ?

- headlight on cages level ? By torch item ?
  No ? Spot headlight looks poor (must over-triangulate meshes),
  and it doesn't resemble a torch anyway. Positional light with attenuation
  also doesn't look too special.

- Things that I would like to show in new levels:
  - swimming feels great --- show it off more ?
  - lights: Spot light. Moving light.
  - Some moving objects on the level: this is easy to do in my levels. Use it more !
  - more environ sounds: wind blowing.

- "Set keys to "Half life 2" scheme" menu command ?

- chooseNewLevel menu: display thumbnails of levels

- when player walks, his weapon should slowly move

- mouse smoothing for mouse look ?
  Seems not needed, at least with my mouse ?
  Players with poor mouses can always just use keys ?

- fix GTK backend to resize screen (surprisingly, it seems that I should
  just use XFV86VidMode from Xlib ? GTK does not wrap this ?)
  and then compile release versions of "The Castle" with GTK backend,
  avoiding override_redirect.

- Mama reports:
  Po uruchomieniu castle.exe mam taki komunikat:
    Error
    castle: Exception EAccessViolation:
    Access violation
  pod windows'98

- creature's footsteps sound ?

- sound when creature sees player for the 1st time

- player should also get "knockback" when creature hits him.

- music volume is affected by sound volume now. That's because listener gain affects everything...

- Add names of guys that did the loops, maybe send them mails ? Some of the loops are plainly great!

- choosing Min/MaxALAllocatedSounds from menu.

- why with wide angle the corner geometry is sometimes clipped ?

- Creatures<->level collision checking should be done using
  creature's bounding box, not CameraRadius.
  Creature's CameraRadius is a hack, and should be preferably removed.
  Same thing for items<->level.

- "Restore defaults" in Sound options.

- Eric stage 4 comment:
  - you can also get "stuck" when colliding against a wall, instead of sliding.

- Enemies:
  - More enemies attacks.
  - Nice 3d effects (lighting-like things, explosions etc.).
  - Models of the two current creatures need to be improved.
    Model of "alien" creature will probably be just removed and replaced
    by something else.
  - Just add more creatures.
    creature hydra (very tall, very long when killed; will be a nice demo of my good collision checking routines)
    creature that attacks by snapping it hand (tentacle ?) far out

- "The Gate" level:
  - intro under menu: camera floating around level with this fog ?

- There must be a way to say that some sectors are not important
  for AI for creatures with Flying. (like ghost)

- sectors and waypoints finish, see README for TO-DOs.

- Improve collisions player<->creatures and player<->items to
  check not only final collisions, but also segment collisions when moving ?
  Otherwise when moving fast (or low FPS count, so FpsCompSpeed large),
  this collision check can fail to work.

  This doesn't seem to be a problem in practice, in practice moving speed is
  not so large (unless running on some ancient GPU with 1 frame per second,
  but there the game is not playable anyway...).

- do weather (I have snow and rain from my szklane_lasy, but they look poor...)

- weapon-less attack (does knockback + small damage)

- non-moving creature (just shooting etc.)

- avoiding falling down sometimes doesn't work like it should.
  I think that I know why: I check where the creature will be after
  2 secs, but what if there is a pit between 2 secs and current pos ?
  Fix by checking everything *along the 2 secs way*.

- ball_missile looks rather funny, too colorful.
  It must look like something fiery, or lighting, or just anything
  that seems at least a little dangerous :)

- various kinds of swinging the sword, with various animations.
  Also they can yield various damage and various hit chances.

- Smooth between various creature states.
  I.e. expand the idea of StandToWalkAnimation, for every combination
  and make it automatic.
  Problem: long load times ("Loading creatures...") and memory consumption.

- creatures can climb high (almost-vertical) walls.
  Actually, player can climb almost-vertical walls too !

  This is not so very noticeable now, because there are no high walls
  now, and creatures' AI doesn't let them fall into deep pits now.

  As a workaround, basic_castle's moat has now edges that are wider down,
  so player and creatures are never able to climb up from the moat...
  But that's still just a workaround.

- some effects: blood explode when player hits monster.

- I really don't like the "alien" model. It's generally nice,
  but it doesn't fit this game, and I just can't texture it appropriately.
  The basic model was just taken from www.3dcafe.com when I realized that
  I don't have time to make some really nice creature model before
  stage 4 deadline.

  So this creature model is scheduled to be removed and replaced by something
  better after stage 4 deadline.

- in game, in config controls, escape should go back to game.

- put some vertical crates around GlassPrison on basic_castle

- shadows under the creatures:
  - need to be optimized to enabled by default.
    Then set DefaultRenderShadows to true, and remove the warning in
    CastleStartMenu when changing RenderShadows.

  GDC2003_ShadowVolumes.pdf has many interesting ideas.
  Idea to eliminate occluders based on Frustum+LightPos seems suitable for me
  and relatively easy, implement ?

  Implement and use (when you have to) ZFail,
  test like descr in GDC2003_ShadowVolumes.pdf.

  Add creature option CastsShadow (def true) to turn shadows off
  for some creatures. For ball missile turn them off.

  LightCastingShadowsPosition should be cofigurable.
  Can be inited from LightSet.Lights[0].TransfLocation
  (but this doesn't give so much results usually...)

- "shrink" spell (that was *coool* in DUKE 3D !)
  "freeze" (it's from DUKE 3D also)
  "fry"
  "throw back" (throws all enemies slightly backward --- this is also useful
     for player to actually see that monsters get hurt when falling from high)

- Maybe it's sometimes a good idea to not create separate display
  list for each animation frame. Instead, it two scenes share the same RootNode
  and differ e.g. only in CurrentMatrix states, then I can use
  one display list and do glPushMatrix,MultMatrix,render,PopMatrix.

  This could save some loading time for e.g. ball_missile anim
  (but not for alien animations, as they change geometry).

  This is also required to convert Symbol and Button on "Castle Hall"
  to use TVRMLGLAnimation class (additional simplification will be that
  only one Symbol model will be needed, not 4 (like now)).

- intro moving when the game starts (either movie from the game --- or just some
  nice anim ? Look how much it adds to AirBlast !)

- second weapon, crossbow/bow, that requires another item in your inventory
  (bolts/arrows)

  When you hold attack key, arrow/bolt appears on your bow/crossbow
  and you're holding the bow. There is also a crosshair (circle target area)
  that "trembles", because your hands are trembling.

  You shoot when you release Ctrl key. The longer you held Ctrl,
  the more power has the arrow (more velocity), but also the trembling
  of your crosshair (and it's circle) is larger, so your accuracy
  is lower.

- inventory should be able to scroll, when more than MaxInventorySlots items
  are available.

- change the name --- there already exists game named "castle"!
  And there is "Castle Adventure" !

  "Castle in the rock"
  "High castle"
  "Castle above the mist" ?

- idea from quake: water surface slowly moving (change/move the texture?
  some deformation of the texture ? I'm not sure how to do this trick,
  but it looks very nice!)

- Some buttons visible at lower part of the screen to access some
  things with mouse and to show (as hints) their key shortcuts ?
  ("i" - inventory on/off, "m" - messages).

- debug menu is only for testing -- hide somehow at some point.

- mail to author of
  http://www.astrooptik.com/Bildergalerie/latest_namibia/pictures.htm
  : permission to use stars.jpg in my game ?

- apply nice "strips" texture to handle of the sword,
  see http://mediawiki.blender.org/index.php/Manual/PartII/Basic_Mesh_Modelling

- some alpha rect around the item's model ?
  test, although it seems that rotating is enough.

- Not bad creature models from www.3dcafe.com:

  horror/abom
  anatomy_people/creature
  anatomy_people/vampire

  /win/3dmodels/www.katorlegaz.com/animals/horse

- Load / save game ability.

  Place load in the start menu.
  Place save in the game menu.
  In the game menu, when asking before "End Game", do question
  like "Do you want to save the game before ending ?"
  with answers "Save and end the game", "Don't save and end the game", "Cancel".
